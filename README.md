You can download a .exe which automaticly renames your files, so that the prefix will be date of the last modification

<h2>How do you use it?</h2>
It is really simple. In the 'ignoredFileTypes.ini' file you have to change the directory you want to get observed.
Optionally you can add fileendings which should not get their name changed.
After this you just have to start 'Filesotierer.exe'#
The Programm works recursive which means that subdiretories are also affected.
  
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
As the time being there is no feature to observe multiple directories at one. But I am working on it.
I have to add  that the programm has no autostart feature so you either have to add it. Either via the taskmanager or in the windows settings.
